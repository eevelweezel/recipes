# Leek & Potato Mushroom Heaven... ahem, Soup.


2 lbs leeks, washed & thinly sliced white and green parts separated

sea salt to taste

2 tbsp butter

1-3 c mushrooms (oyster, button, etc... pickled chantrelles are heavenly)

1 sliced zucchini

3 - 5 cloves garlic, minced

1.5  tsp. ground white pepper

3 tsp ground black pepper

2 tsp. ground coriander

1 tsp. fennel seeds

1 1/2 lb. chopped Yukon gold potatoes (3 large or 6 small)

4 c. vegetable broth

1 can coconut milk 


1. Combine dry spices in a small skillet, and toast until fragrant. Set aside.

2. In a large pot over medium heat, heat enough oil to thinly coat the bottom of the pot. Add in leek greens and stir, frying until golden and crispy, about 6 minutes. Transfer fried leeks to a plate.

3. Return pot to medium-high heat and melt butter. Add in remaining leeks, zucchini, mushrooms, and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, slightly golden, and volume has decreased by over half, about 20 minutes. 

4. Push vegetables to the sides of the pot and add in 1 tablespoon oil more. Add garlic and dry spice mixture. Stir until mixed and spices are fragrant.  Taste and correct seasoning.

5. Add potatoes and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot with a lid, and let cook until potatoes are falling apart, about 30 minutes.

6. Remove from heat and stir in 2/3 c coconut milk. Use a potato masher to partially mash potatoes to desired consistency.

Serve soup topped with a swirl of coconut milk, some fried leek greens, and a sprinkle of Parmesan.
