# Potato Soup

2-3 red potatoes

2 medium yellow onions

5-6 carrots, celery stalks, or parsnips

1/2 lb mushrooms (crimini, portabella, etc.)

5-6 tbsp butter

Chop produce and mushrooms. 

Melt ~4 tbsp of butter over medium heat and stir-fry vegetables.

Add boiling water to cover, and remaining butter.

Let simmer to reduce, then season to taste.  I use cayenne, cumin, and tarragon. Dill's also good.

Add 2% milk to taste (about 3 cups? Use more for creamier soup). Simmer to reduce, on lower heat. Check and correct seasoning again.
