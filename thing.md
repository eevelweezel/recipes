olive oil

1 lb. meat (fake or real)

5 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed

2-3 tomatoes

1 cup gravy (vegan or brown)

1/2 cup heavy cream or greek yogurt

1/4 cup Parmesan or Romano cheese

1 pile fresh oregano

1 pile fresh rosemary

cayenne pepper to taste

1 lb. penne pasta

For topping: 1 cup coarsely grated Mozzarella or Swiss cheese


1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2.  Put four quarts of water on to boil in a large pot.
3.  Heat a large skillet and add oil and garlic. If using real meat, add it now and cook until browned. Add tomatoes and cook until they release their liquid, then simmer for 3-5 minutes. Add all remaining ingredients except pasta and topping. If using fake meat, add it now.
4.  Simmer the mixture while the pasta cooks until just barely tender.
5.  Drain pasta and mix with ingredients in skillet.  Pour into a 3 quart rectangular baking dish (9 X 13 inch pan).  Top with remaining cheese.
6.  Bake for 25 minutes or until all is bubbly hot.


To make vegan, replace dairy in pasta with 1/4 c coconut milk and 1/2 c tahini. Replace cheese topping with panko and chopped cashews (or pine nuts).


Serves 6.
